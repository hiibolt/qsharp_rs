The main.rs file contains numerous examples implementing exercises from the Microsoft Quantum Katas:

```rust

let mut system = System::new();
system.allocate();
system.allocate();
system[0].unwrap_qubit().H();  // Put first qubit in superposition
system.CNOT(0, 1);             // Entangle with second qubit
system.dump();                 // Display the entangled state
```

```rust
// Prepare an arbitrary quantum state
let mut system = System::new();
let q = system.allocate();
q.R_y(theta);  // Rotate to desired amplitude
q.R_1(phi);    // Apply phase rotation
q.measure();   // Display measurement probabilities

### Bra-Ket Notation
![Bra-Ket Basics](https://github.com/hiibolt/qsharp_rs/assets/91273156/99a6ca77-5579-4c18-96ea-bd22c8f8d12a)

- You can imagine ‚ü®x|y‚ü© as the inner product of |x‚ü© and |y‚ü© because they're notationally connected _internally_ via the connector.
- Likewise, you can imagine |x‚ü©‚ü®y| as the outer product because |x‚ü© and |y‚ü© are not connected internally, so they're _outside_ the norm.

#### Gate Representation
This allows you to represent entire gates as a series of Dirac notations without ever technically re-entering matrix territory.

Basic example of how the X (inversion) gate can be represented solely with Dirac notation:
![X Gate Dirac](https://github.com/hiibolt/qsharp_rs/assets/91273156/ec63af1a-8ed4-40b5-8f53-fba47c5edb7c)

This allows fast computation without ever using matrices, which can be seen here flipping |0‚ü© to |1‚ü© in Dirac notation:

### Gate Building
#### I-Gate usage to access only certain qubits
- Tensor Product with I-Gate as the base of the operation: Push up
- Tensor Product with I-Gate as the operand of the operation: Push back

#### Example Gate Usage
Given a system of 3 qubits, in order to ignore the first and third qubits and only apply the X-Gate to the second qubit, you would build a gate as follows:
$$(I \otimes X \otimes I) * Q_s$$
