# Rust Implementations of the Q# documentation

Intended to end as a quantum circuit simulator written in Rust, rendered in Bevy, and packaged by Nix.

This project was primarily a means to learn Rust and choice topics in quantum compilers.

## Bra-Ket notation
### Basics:

- You can imagine <x|y> as the inner product of |x> and |y> because they're notationally connected _internally_ via the connector.
- Likewise, you can imagine |x> <y| as the outer product because of |x> and |y> because, well, they're not connected internally or pointing to eachother, so they're _outside_ the norm.
### Gate Representation
This allows you to represent entire gates as a series of Dirac notations without ever technically re-entering matrix territory. 

Basic example of how the X (inversion) gate can be represented solely with Dirac notation:

This allows fast computation without ever using matrices, which can be seen here flipping |0> to |1> in Dirac notation:

## Gate-Building
### I-Gate usage to access only certain qubits
- Tensor Product with I-Gate as the base of the operation: Push up
- Tensor Product with I-Gate as the operand of the operation: Push back
### Example Gate Usage:
Given a system of 3 qubits, in order to ignore the first and third qubits and only apply the X-Gate to the second qubit, you would build a gate as follows:
$$(I \otimes X \otimes I) * Q_s$$
